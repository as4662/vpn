A Virtual Private Network (VPN) is a network that is used to create a private scope of computer communications or to provide a secure extension of a private network over an insecure network such as the Internet.
IP Sec or Secure Socket Layer can be used to build a VPN (SSL). These are two fundamentally distinct approaches to VPN development.
In our work, we concentrated on SSL-based VPNs, sometimes known as SSL VPNs. We have used Cisco Packet Tracer to accomplish this purpose.

A virtual private network (VPN) extends a private network across a public network and enables users to send and receive data across shared or public networks as if their computing devices were directly connected to the private network. 
The benefits of a VPN include increases in functionality, security, and management of the private network. 

VPN provides access to resources that are inaccessible on the public network and is typically used for remote workers. Encryption is common, although not an inherent part of a VPN connection.

A VPN is created by establishing a virtual point-to-point connection through the use of dedicated circuits or with tunneling protocols over existing networks.

A VPN available from the public Internet can provide some of the benefits of a wide area network (WAN). From a user perspective, the resources available within the private network can be accessed remotely.
